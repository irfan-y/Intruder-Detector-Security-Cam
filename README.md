# Intruder-Detector-Security-Cam

## The Intruder Detector Security Cam is a Python based mini project that utilizes OpenCV for real-time face detection. This captures video from a webcam, detects faces in the video stream using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier, and saves the detected faces as image files. 

## It is a basic application of computer vision techniques for security purposes. It is a simple yet effective way to monitor and record activity in a specified area, capturing images of anyone who comes into view of the camera.

## It is designed to function as a simple security monitoring tool, allowing users to capture and store images of individuals who appear in front of the camera.

## Update the cascade_path variable in the script with the path to the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file.
